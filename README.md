# 2. Mailman Problem solution via Finite Domain Representation (FDR) tool
# 3. Final Java application :
  - Goal : path finding based on a criterion (time or distance) between two given cities in Greece (A*, Greedy Best First Search algorithms)
  - Output : 
    - 1. Algorithm selected
    - 2. Nodes expanded
    - 3. Path generated (source city, intermediate cities, destination city)
    - 4. Path length
    - 5. Cost (time or km)
  - User interface :
    - 1. Ability to create a new file containing cities (Format : city name, latitude, longitude)
    - 2. Ability to create a new file containing roads  (Format : road name, source city name, destination city name, distance(km), mean travel duration)
    - 3. Delete a file
    - 4. Show a file's contents
    - 5. Merge a file containing cities with a file containing roads
    - 6. Split a file containing cities and roads
    - 7. Replace an entry in a file
    - 8. Add an entry to a file
    - 9. Find the latitude and longitude of a specific city
    - 10.Select a file for path finding
    - 11.Quit program
