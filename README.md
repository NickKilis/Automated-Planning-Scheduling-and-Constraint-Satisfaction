# 2. Mailman Problem solution via Finite Domain Representation (FDR) tool
# 3. Final Java application :
  - Goal : path finding based on a criterion (time or distance) between two given cities in Greece (A*, Greedy Best First Search algorithms)
  - Output : 
    - Algorithm selected
    - Nodes expanded
    - Path generated (source city, intermediate cities, destination city)
    - Path length
    - Cost (time or km)
  - User interface :
    - Ability to create a new file containing cities (Format : city name, latitude, longitude)
    - Ability to create a new file containing roads  (Format : road name, source city name, destination city name, distance(km), mean travel duration)
    - Delete a file
    - Show a file's contents
    - Merge a file containing cities with a file containing roads
    - Split a file containing cities and roads
    - Replace an entry in a file
    - Add an entry to a file
    - Find the latitude and longitude of a specific city
    - Select a file for path finding
    - Quit program
